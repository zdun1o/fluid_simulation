## About

Welcome to the 2D Fluid Simulation repository! This project implements a real-time 2D fluid simulation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) principles. It provides a visual representation of fluid behavior, allowing users to interact with and observe fluid dynamics in a 2D environment.

## Features

- Real-time 2D fluid simulation
- Visualization of velocity and density fields
- User-friendly interface for interactive simulation
- Adding walls to field of simulation
- Reset Simulation
- Rotate
